<h1>This is the Example Content H1 Tag</h1>
<p>
The HTML example content is designed to provide some dummy content to help
you design your typography and general CSS styles, and to ensure that you've
accounted for <em>every single</em> HTML5 tag in your stylesheet.
</p>

<h2>Normal, Basic Stuff headed by this H2 Tag</h2>

<p>
This is a normal paragraph.  It contains some text.  According to
<a href="http://www.threestyles.com/tutorials/css-tips-for-better-typography/" title="The ultimate guide to CSS Typography">some sources</a>,
paragraphs should be 30em x the font size (for example, 10px font size = 300px wide paragraph).  Use <em>ems</em> to
make this happen.  Also, line height should be 6 - 7px bigger than the font size.   It may or may
not be appropriate to use <em>ems</em> for this.  Here is some <small>small text</small>
</p>

<p>
Complex computer systems find their way into everyday life, and at the same time the market is saturated with competing brands. This has made usability more popular and widely recognized in recent years, as companies see the benefits of researching and developing their products with user-oriented methods instead of technology-oriented methods. By understanding and researching the interaction between product and user, the usability expert can also provide insight that is unattainable by traditional company-oriented market research. For example, after observing and interviewing users, the usability expert may identify needed functionality or design flaws that were not anticipated. A method called contextual inquiry does this in the naturally occurring context of the users own environment.
</p>

<h3>A Level Three Heading</h3>

<p>
There is no consensus about the relation of the terms ergonomics (or human factors) and usability. Some think of usability as the software specialization of the larger topic of ergonomics. Others view these topics as tangential, with ergonomics focusing on physiological matters (e.g., turning a door handle) and usability focusing on psychological matters (e.g., recognizing that a door can be opened by turning its handle).
</p>

<h4>Level Four Heading</h4>

This seems like a good place for an image:
</p>

<p>
<img src="http://dummyimage.com/400x250/333/fff.png" alt="Dummy Image" />
</p>

<p>
Okay, so here's something kind of sort of new.  The figure tags are very useful when displaying
images with figures and captions and what-not.  This paragraph needs to be a little longer,
so here comes some lorum ipsum!  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed
diam nonummy nibh euismod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore magna aliquam erat volutpat. Ut wisi enim
ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exerci tation ullamcorper suscipit lobortis nisl ut aliquip ex ea
commodo consequat. Duis autem vel eum iriure dolor in hendrerit in vulputate velit esse molestie
consequat, vel illum dolore eu feugiat nulla facilisis at vero eros et accumsan et iusto odio.
</p>

<figure>
  <img src="http://dummyimage.com/400x250/666/fff.png" alt="Dummy Figure Image" />
  <figcaption>
    This is the figure caption of what we are looking at.  With <a href='#'>a link</a>.
  </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
The &lt;q&gt; tag is used to define a short quotation: <q cite="http://example.com">do not use me</q>.
</p>

<h3>Blockquotes below</h3>

<blockquote>
The Internet will change the world.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Hello, world.
<blockquote>
  I did not say that!
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are some blockquotes with cite tags</p>

<blockquote>
Stuff is Good.
<cite>Some Dude, 2011</cite>
</blockquote>

<p>
This paragraph contains <a href="#" title="Dummy Link">a link</a>, some <em>em text (typically italicized)</em>, and
some <strong>strong test</strong>, typically bolded.  In addition don't forget to style the &lt;abbr&gt; tag: <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>
tag!  The &lt;sup&gt; tag: 1<sup>st</sup>.  The &lt;sub&gt; tag: M<sub>c</sub>Laughlin.
</p>

<p>
A new tag is the &lt;progress&gt; tag, which shows progress: <progress value="2" max="5">Page 2 of 5</progress>.  Here's another
example: <progress value="76" max="100">76%</progress>.  You can style them based on their <em>value</em> and <em>max</em> attributes.
</p>

<p>
The following content is inside an address tag (most browsers typically render this in italics):
</p>

<address>
<a href="mailto:someone@example.com" title="An Email in an Address">Link to Email</a>
<span>123 Regular Address Lane #A-123, Some City, ST 12345-6789</span>
</address>

<h2>Below this H2 tag is an example of a table</h2>

<h3>Oh, and here is a H3 tag</h3>

<h4>And a H4 Tag right here</h4>

<p>
Here comes a perfectly coded table, with all elements:
</p>

<h5>The table is below this H5 tag</h5>

<table>
<caption>How I feel on different days of the week</caption>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Day of Week</th>
    <th>How I feel</th>
    <th>Score</th>
    <th>Random Number</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <th scope="row">Sunday</th>
    <td>Relaxed</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>15</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>

    <td>That is All</td>
    <td>No more</td>
    <td>Number</td>
    <td>Number</td>
  </tr>
</tfoot>
</table>

<h2>Here comes some code examples under this H2 tag</h2>

<h3>Inline code (this is a h3 tag)</h3>

<p>
It is usually a good idea to use the &lt;code&gt; tag for inline code, like:
<code>this is some code</code>.
There is also the &lt;sampe&gt; tag, which defines sample output (not the same as
code), so you should style it similarly, but perhaps a tiny bit different:
<samp>this is some sample output</samp>.  Also, there is the &lt;kbd&gt; tag for
marking up keyboard input (ie. keystrokes).  Here are some keystrokes:
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + 
<kbd>Alt</kbd> +
<kbd>\</kbd> +
<kbd>Q</kbd>
</p>

<h6>This is just an excuse for me to use the H6 tag in context</h6>

<p>
Final there's the &lt;var&gt; tag.  It's kind of ambiguous, but from best I can
tell, it is used to apply custom markup to a variable inside of a &lt;code&gt; block.
Example:  <code><var>variable</var> = 1234.56</code>.  It is probably a good idea
to style it in normal paragraph context, too: <var>a_variable</var>.
</p>

<h3>Block code H3 Header</h3>

<p>
The above examples describe inline code.  There is also block code, which can be
styled effectively with CSS.  Use the &lt;pre&gt; tag to style that code.  Here is
some basic &lt;pre&gt; tag stuff:
</p>

<pre>
I am the very model of a modern Major-General,
I've information vegetable, animal, and mineral,
I know the kings of England, and I quote the fights historical
From Marathon to Waterloo, in order categorical;
I'm very well acquainted, too, with matters mathematical,
I understand equations, both the simple and quadratical,
About binomial theorem I'm teeming with a lot o' news,
With many cheerful facts about the square of the hypotenuse.

I'm very good at integral and differential calculus;
I know the scientific names of beings animalculous:
In short, in matters vegetable, animal, and mineral,
I am the very model of a modern Major-General.

I know our mythic history, King Arthur's and Sir Caradoc's;
I answer hard acrostics, I've a pretty taste for paradox,
I quote in elegiacs all the crimes of Heliogabalus,
In conics I can floor peculiarities parabolous;
I can tell undoubted Raphaels from Gerard Dows and Zoffanies,
I know the croaking chorus from The Frogs of Aristophanes!
Then I can hum a fugue of which I've heard the music's din afore,
And whistle all the airs from that infernal nonsense Pinafore.
</pre>

<p>
You may want to use the &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; combination to style
preformatted code separately from regular preformatted text:
</p>

<pre class="code">
//a terrible idea -- breaking the right-click functionality on web sites
var message="Copyright Year by Your Site. WARNING ! All content contained within this site is protected by copyright laws. Unauthorized use of our material is strictly prohibited.";

</pre>

<h4>The &lt;del&gt; and &lt;ins&gt; tags H4</h4>
<p>
The &lt;del&gt; and &lt;ins&gt; tags are especially useful in preformatted
blocks.  Typically, you want to use a red background for &lt;del&gt; tags, 
and use a green background for &lt;ins&gt; tags.  Below are some preformatted
blocks in a table with two columns, with these tags in use.
</p>

<table>
<caption>Use of DEL and INS tags</caption>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Old</th>
    <th>New</th>
  </tr>

<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>

<h3>The definition tag H3</h3>

<p>
Finally there's the definition tag: <dfn title="A jerk who never does anything">Steve</dfn>
Oh, and below is a horizontal rule&hellip;
</p>

<hr />

<p>
The &lt;cite&gt; tag is used to provide citations within HTML, similar to how
you would provide footnotes in printed text.  Here is a citation, in context (mouse over it):
As outlined in
<cite title="McPherson, J. M. (1988). Battle cry of freedom: The Civil War era. New York: Oxford University Press.">
  The Battle Cry of Freedom
</cite>, the Civil War had many complex causes.
</p>

<p>
The &lt;summary&gt; tag is a block-level item, that can be used to provide a summary
for an article or section of your site:
</p>

<details>
<summary>Copyright 1999-2011.</summary>
<p>All pages and graphics on this web site are the property of the company Refsnes Data.</p>

<h3>Block code H3 Header</h3>

<h3>The definition tag H3</h3>

<p>
Finally there's the definition tag: <dfn title="A jerk who never does anything">Steve</dfn>
Oh, and below is a horizontal rule&hellip;
</p>

<hr />

<p>
The &lt;cite&gt; tag is used to provide citations within HTML, similar to how
you would provide footnotes in printed text.  Here is a citation, in context (mouse over it):
As outlined in
<cite title="McPherson, J. M. (1988). Battle cry of freedom: The Civil War era. New York: Oxford University Press.">
  The Battle Cry of Freedom
</cite>, the Civil War had many complex causes.
</p>

<p>
The &lt;summary&gt; tag is a block-level item, that can be used to provide a summary
for an article or section of your site:
</p>

<details>
<summary>Copyright 1999-2011.</summary>
<p>All pages and graphics on this web site are the property of the company Refsnes Data.</p>

<h1>This is the Example Content H1 Tag</h1>
<p>
The HTML example content is designed to provide some dummy content to help
you design your typography and general CSS styles, and to ensure that you've
accounted for <em>every single</em> HTML5 tag in your stylesheet.
</p>

<h2>Normal, Basic Stuff headed by this H2 Tag</h2>

<p>
This is a normal paragraph.  It contains some text.  According to
<a href="http://www.threestyles.com/tutorials/css-tips-for-better-typography/" title="The ultimate guide to CSS Typography">some sources</a>,
paragraphs should be 30em x the font size (for example, 10px font size = 300px wide paragraph).  Use <em>ems</em> to
make this happen.  Also, line height should be 6 - 7px bigger than the font size.   It may or may
not be appropriate to use <em>ems</em> for this.  Here is some <small>small text</small>
</p>

<p>
Complex computer systems find their way into everyday life, and at the same time the market is saturated with competing brands. This has made usability more popular and widely recognized in recent years, as companies see the benefits of researching and developing their products with user-oriented methods instead of technology-oriented methods. By understanding and researching the interaction between product and user, the usability expert can also provide insight that is unattainable by traditional company-oriented market research. For example, after observing and interviewing users, the usability expert may identify needed functionality or design flaws that were not anticipated. A method called contextual inquiry does this in the naturally occurring context of the users own environment.
</p>

<h3>A Level Three Heading</h3>

<p>
There is no consensus about the relation of the terms ergonomics (or human factors) and usability. Some think of usability as the software specialization of the larger topic of ergonomics. Others view these topics as tangential, with ergonomics focusing on physiological matters (e.g., turning a door handle) and usability focusing on psychological matters (e.g., recognizing that a door can be opened by turning its handle).
</p>

<h4>Level Four Heading</h4>

This seems like a good place for an image:

<p>

</p>

<p>
Okay, so here's something kind of sort of new.  The figure tags are very useful when displaying
images with figures and captions and what-not.  This paragraph needs to be a little longer,
so here comes some lorum ipsum!  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed
diam nonummy nibh euismod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore magna aliquam erat volutpat. Ut wisi enim
ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exerci tation ullamcorper suscipit lobortis nisl ut aliquip ex ea
commodo consequat. Duis autem vel eum iriure dolor in hendrerit in vulputate velit esse molestie
consequat, vel illum dolore eu feugiat nulla facilisis at vero eros et accumsan et iusto odio.

  <figcaption>
    This is the figure caption of what we are looking at.  With <a href='#'>a link</a>.
  </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
The &lt;q&gt; tag is used to define a short quotation: <q cite="http://example.com">do not use me</q>.
</p>

<h3>Blockquotes below</h3>

<blockquote>
The Internet will change the world.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Hello, world.
<blockquote>
  I did not say that!
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are some blockquotes with cite tags</p>

<blockquote>
Stuff is Good.
<cite>Some Dude, 2011</cite>
</blockquote>

<p>
This paragraph contains <a href="#" title="Dummy Link">a link</a>, some <em>em text (typically italicized)</em>, and
some <strong>strong test</strong>, typically bolded.  In addition don't forget to style the &lt;abbr&gt; tag: <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>
tag!  The &lt;sup&gt; tag: 1<sup>st</sup>.  The &lt;sub&gt; tag: M<sub>c</sub>Laughlin.
</p>

<p>
A new tag is the &lt;progress&gt; tag, which shows progress: <progress value="2" max="5">Page 2 of 5</progress>.  Here's another
example: <progress value="76" max="100">76%</progress>.  You can style them based on their <em>value</em> and <em>max</em> attributes.
</p>

<p>
The following content is inside an address tag (most browsers typically render this in italics):
</p>

<address>
<a href="mailto:someone@example.com" title="An Email in an Address">Link to Email</a>
<span>123 Regular Address Lane #A-123, Some City, ST 12345-6789</span>
</address>

<h2>Below this H2 tag is an example of a table</h2>

<h3>Oh, and here is a H3 tag</h3>

<h4>And a H4 Tag right here</h4>

<p>
Here comes a perfectly coded table, with all elements:
</p>

<h5>The table is below this H5 tag</h5>

<table>

    <td>Number</td>
    <td>Number</td>
  </tr>
</tfoot>
</table>

<h2>Here comes some code examples under this H2 tag</h2>

<h3>Inline code (this is a h3 tag)</h3>

<p>
It is usually a good idea to use the &lt;code&gt; tag for inline code, like:
<code>this is some code</code>.
There is also the &lt;sampe&gt; tag, which defines sample output (not the same as
code), so you should style it similarly, but perhaps a tiny bit different:
<samp>this is some sample output</samp>.  Also, there is the &lt;kbd&gt; tag for
marking up keyboard input (ie. keystrokes).  Here are some keystrokes:
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + 
<kbd>Alt</kbd> +
<kbd>\</kbd> +
<kbd>Q</kbd>
</p>

<h6>This is just an excuse for me to use the H6 tag in context</h6>

<p>
Final there's the &lt;var&gt; tag.  It's kind of ambiguous, but from best I can
tell, it is used to apply custom markup to a variable inside of a &lt;code&gt; block.
Example:  <code><var>variable</var> = 1234.56</code>.  It is probably a good idea
to style it in normal paragraph context, too: <var>a_variable</var>.
</p>

<h3>Block code H3 Header</h3>

<p>
The above examples describe inline code.  There is also block code, which can be
styled effectively with CSS.  Use the &lt;pre&gt; tag to style that code.  Here is
some basic &lt;pre&gt; tag stuff:
</p>

<pre>
I am the very model of a modern Major-General,
I've information vegetable, animal, and mineral,
I know the kings of England, and I quote the fights historical
From Marathon to Waterloo, in order categorical;
I'm very well acquainted, too, with matters mathematical,
I understand equations, both the simple and quadratical,
About binomial theorem I'm teeming with a lot o' news,
With many cheerful facts about the square of the hypotenuse.

I'm very good at integral and differential calculus;
I know the scientific names of beings animalculous:
In short, in matters vegetable, animal, and mineral,
I am the very model of a modern Major-General.

I know our mythic history, King Arthur's and Sir Caradoc's;
I answer hard acrostics, I've a pretty taste for paradox,
I quote in elegiacs all the crimes of Heliogabalus,
In conics I can floor peculiarities parabolous;
I can tell undoubted Raphaels from Gerard Dows and Zoffanies,
I know the croaking chorus from The Frogs of Aristophanes!
Then I can hum a fugue of which I've heard the music's din afore,
And whistle all the airs from that infernal nonsense Pinafore.
</pre>

<p>
You may want to use the &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; combination to style
preformatted code separately from regular preformatted text:
</p>

<pre class="code">
//a terrible idea -- breaking the right-click functionality on web sites
var message="Copyright Year by Your Site. WARNING ! All content contained within this site is protected by copyright laws. Unauthorized use of our material is strictly prohibited.";

</pre>

<h4>The &lt;del&gt; and &lt;ins&gt; tags H4</h4>
<p>
The &lt;del&gt; and &lt;ins&gt; tags are especially useful in preformatted
blocks.  Typically, you want to use a red background for &lt;del&gt; tags, 
and use a green background for &lt;ins&gt; tags.  Below are some preformatted
blocks in a table with two columns, with these tags in use.
</p>

<table>

    <th>New</th>

<h2>Here comes some code examples under this H2 tag</h2>

<h3>Inline code (this is a h3 tag)</h3>

<p>
It is usually a good idea to use the &lt;code&gt; tag for inline code, like:
<code>this is some code</code>.
There is also the &lt;sampe&gt; tag, which defines sample output (not the same as
code), so you should style it similarly, but perhaps a tiny bit different:
<samp>this is some sample output</samp>.  Also, there is the &lt;kbd&gt; tag for
marking up keyboard input (ie. keystrokes).  Here are some keystrokes:
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + 
<kbd>Alt</kbd> +
<kbd>\</kbd> +
<kbd>Q</kbd>
</p>

<h6>This is just an excuse for me to use the H6 tag in context</h6>

<p>
Final there's the &lt;var&gt; tag.  It's kind of ambiguous, but from best I can
tell, it is used to apply custom markup to a variable inside of a &lt;code&gt; block.
Example:  <code><var>variable</var> = 1234.56</code>.  It is probably a good idea
to style it in normal paragraph context, too: <var>a_variable</var>.
</p>

<h3>Block code H3 Header</h3>

<p>
The above examples describe inline code.  There is also block code, which can be
styled effectively with CSS.  Use the &lt;pre&gt; tag to style that code.  Here is
some basic &lt;pre&gt; tag stuff:
</p>

<pre>
I am the very model of a modern Major-General,
I've information vegetable, animal, and mineral,
I know the kings of England, and I quote the fights historical
From Marathon to Waterloo, in order categorical;
I'm very well acquainted, too, with matters mathematical,
I understand equations, both the simple and quadratical,
About binomial theorem I'm teeming with a lot o' news,
With many cheerful facts about the square of the hypotenuse.

I'm very good at integral and differential calculus;
I know the scientific names of beings animalculous:
In short, in matters vegetable, animal, and mineral,
I am the very model of a modern Major-General.

I know our mythic history, King Arthur's and Sir Caradoc's;
I answer hard acrostics, I've a pretty taste for paradox,
I quote in elegiacs all the crimes of Heliogabalus,
In conics I can floor peculiarities parabolous;
I can tell undoubted Raphaels from Gerard Dows and Zoffanies,
I know the croaking chorus from The Frogs of Aristophanes!
Then I can hum a fugue of which I've heard the music's din afore,
And whistle all the airs from that infernal nonsense Pinafore.
</pre>

<p>
You may want to use the &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; combination to style
preformatted code separately from regular preformatted text:
</p>

<pre class="code">
//a terrible idea -- breaking the right-click functionality on web sites
var message="Copyright Year by Your Site. WARNING ! All content contained within this site is protected by copyright laws. Unauthorized use of our material is strictly prohibited.";

</pre>

<h4>The &lt;del&gt; and &lt;ins&gt; tags H4</h4>
<p>
The &lt;del&gt; and &lt;ins&gt; tags are especially useful in preformatted
blocks.  Typically, you want to use a red background for &lt;del&gt; tags, 
and use a green background for &lt;ins&gt; tags.  Below are some preformatted
blocks in a table with two columns, with these tags in use.
</p>

<h3>The definition tag H3</h3>

<p>
Finally there's the definition tag: <dfn title="A jerk who never does anything">Steve</dfn>
Oh, and below is a horizontal rule&hellip;
</p>

<hr />

<p>
The &lt;cite&gt; tag is used to provide citations within HTML, similar to how
you would provide footnotes in printed text.  Here is a citation, in context (mouse over it):
As outlined in
<cite title="McPherson, J. M. (1988). Battle cry of freedom: The Civil War era. New York: Oxford University Press.">
  The Battle Cry of Freedom
</cite>, the Civil War had many complex causes.
</p>

<p>
The &lt;summary&gt; tag is a block-level item, that can be used to provide a summary
for an article or section of your site:
</p>

<details>
<summary>Copyright 1999-2011.</summary>
<p>All pages and graphics on this web site are the property of the company Refsnes Data.</p>
