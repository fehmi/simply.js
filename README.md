## What is simply.js

!> This project is in an alpha state and non-production ready.

Simply.js is a web component library for developing web application user interfaces. It is created by a designer to make it easy to develop atomic design system components and compositions. It uses native [Custom Elements API](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/customelements) of the [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) standard and provides a single file component concept which helps to write HTML, CSS and JavaScript codes in one encapsulated single file.

It has a built-in super-fast declarative template engine coded from scratch. Some parts of simply.js are respectfully forked from other beautiful projects. For example; [obaa.js](https://github.com/Tencent/omi/blob/v6.18.0/packages/omix/utils/obaa.js) for reactive variables, [morphdom](https://github.com/patrick-steele-idem/morphdom) for DOM diffing/patching and an old version (1.3) of [Vaadin](https://github.com/vaadin/router/tree/v1.3.0) for the router.

Long story short, simply.js is the name of the brand new template engine and the bridge between the adopted tools.


## How it works

You will need to have basic understanding with [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp), [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) and [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) to work with simply.js. They are relatively easy to learn languages when you think Super Mario was [hand-written](https://gist.github.com/1wErt3r/4048722) with 6502 assembly 40 years ago by Toshihiko Nakago. So don't worry about to jump in to learn them. [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) is a great stating point. You don't have to learn their every details. The big part of programming is to know how to search things on Google nowadays :)

While you are working with simply.js everything will run in the browser of the user. So no compiler, no bundler, no builder, no config files. Just good old plain HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript and your [favourite text editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/). That's all.
