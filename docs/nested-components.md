# Nested Components

You can embed other components within your components. This follows the same principle as your main component. You can achieve this by using the `get` function at the beginning of your parent component's script tag. Then, you can call the nested component using its tag (`child-component`) within your template tag. There is no limit to the number of nested components. Here is an example of `child-component` content that calls `grand-child-component`.
