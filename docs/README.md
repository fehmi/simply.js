# What is simply.js

UX first vanilla JavaScript toolkit developed by a designer. It uses native [Custom Elements API](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/customelements) of the [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) standard. Simply.js provides a [single file component](https://ckeditor.com/blog/implementing-single-file-web-components/) concept which helps to write HTML, CSS and JavaScript codes in a one encapsulated single file. It has built-in super fast declarative template engine coded from scratch.

Some parts of simply.js respectfully forked from other beautiful projects. For example; [obaa.js](https://github.com/Tencent/omi/blob/v6.18.0/packages/omix/utils/obaa.js) for reactive variables, [morphdom](https://github.com/patrick-steele-idem/morphdom) for DOM diffing/patching and an old version (1.3) of [Vaadin](https://github.com/vaadin/router/tree/v1.3.0) for router.

Long story short, simply.js is the name of the brand new template engine and the bridge between the forked tools. That is why it is called as a toolkit.

See the [Quick start](quickstart.md) guide for more details.
